# Jesse's Daily Thought/Rant:

Am I wasting my time by dedicating all of my free time towards learning Flutter/Dart, two skills that don't seem to be very marketable in the current tech industry? Nah, I can't really think about things like that. This is the first time I have felt myself having fun while coding in a long time. I also can't think about what is popular in the present, mainly because I am currently not married to any company, product, or tech stack. I have to trust that Flutter and Dart will become a lot more popular in the future; and when that time comes, I will be ahead of most people. Maybe I am just dreaming of an optimistic future where everything goes exactly as I would like and I can both have fun with my profession, as well as finally become a marketable individual. Sure, maybe I should be brushing up on and honing my React/JavaScript skills; but web development makes me hate my life, and I am not going to force myself to do anything that makes me dread opening up my laptop. For now,  I will focus on doing what I have fun with and hope that it pays off...maybe I should at least dust off the ole LeetCode link. That is it. That is what is on my mind. Now it's time to make this quiz app.
